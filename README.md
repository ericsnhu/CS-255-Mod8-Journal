DriverPass wanted to create a system which allowed students to take practice test and schedule in person driving lessons with an instructor.
I felt I did a good job and creating charts since it was my first attempt at half of those charts.
I would revise the class diagram. I feel that it does not portray the exact secuence and abilty that the system has to offer.
